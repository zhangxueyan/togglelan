Every teacher is like a green leaf. Under the leadership of the college, he is carrying out photosynthesis, nurturing flowers, fruits and fragrant peaches and plums. As a full-time college, we should not only devote ourselves to the improvement of students knowledge, but also emphasize the improvement of students personal quality and character. Let us cherish a grateful heart and thank parents for giving our children to us at ease. We should convey our love, our wisdom and our gratitude to every student. Gratitude is an attitude towards life, a virtue, a piece of heartfelt words. <br> Modern children are the center of the family. They only know how to love themselves and others. Not only do many students not appreciate their parents hard work, but they endlessly ask for, buy food, buy clothes and go to Internet cafes. In their eyes, it is natural to ask parents for money. Among College students, many students ask for money from their parents, but less than one-tenth of them write to their families to greet them. We shouldn not do this. We should always be considerate of others. When parents give you something, they should say "Thank you". They should do some housework for their parents. They should also study hard to repay teachers and schools. <br> The American folk song Old Black Slave,'
